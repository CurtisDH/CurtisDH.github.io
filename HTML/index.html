      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a versatile full-stack software developer, I am driven by a
        deep-rooted passion for problem-solving and innovation. Beginning my
        journey as a self-taught developer, I chose to further hone my skills
        with a Computer Science degree from Queensland University of
        Technology. This fusion of formal and self-guided learning has
        empowered me with a broad skill set, encompassing numerous programming
        languages, front-end technologies, and databases. Leveraging these
        abilities, I continually strive to architect innovative, efficient
        solutions.

      <h2>Experience & Education</h2>
      <p>
        As an aspiring Computer Science graduate from Queensland University of
        Technology, my academic and hands-on experience has allowed me to
        acquire a broad understanding of computing principles. Previously, I
        enhanced my technical acumen with a Diploma in Computer Systems
        Networking and Telecommunications from TAFE Queensland.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey has led me to contribute significantly to
        projects with prominent organizations such as Queensland Police and
        YesVR. Here, I was instrumental in interfacing with clients and
        pinpointing their business needs. I have a proven record of adapting
        to team environments and deploying agile methodologies for maximum
        efficiency. Alongside these, I've gained proficiency in project
        management tools like Jira and Asana, further enhancing my ability to
        deliver robust and timely solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My passion for software development is not limited to my academic and
        professional journey. A host of personal projects, showcased below,
        further reflect my commitment to learning, creating, and improving in
