        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a versatile full-stack software developer with a deep commitment
          to problem-solving and innovation. I began my journey as a self-taught
          developer and further honed my skills by obtaining a Computer Science
          degree from Queensland University of Technology. This combination of
          formal education and self-guided learning has equipped me with a
          diverse skill set that spans various programming languages, front-end
          technologies, and databases. I leverage these skills to architect
          innovative and efficient solutions.
